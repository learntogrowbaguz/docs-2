# Identity Profiles

Identity Profiles allow users to hide their [`Genesis Identifier`](identifier.md) during interactions. Instead, users will be identified by their [`Identity Profile`](../../protocol/spec.md#identity-profiles-new).

An Identity Profile is generated by hashing the `id` with a `profileNonce` (a random number generated by the identity owner).

```
profileHash = hash(genesisId, profileNonce)

profileId = idType + profileHashCut + checksum
```
where:
* idType - identifier of DID method and blockchain network & subnetwork, 2 bytes
* profileHashCut - first 27 bytes of profileHash, 27 bytes
* checksum - control checksum, 2 bytes
* profileNonce - random number generated by the identity owner, 31 bytes (actually max ~253 bits to fit into the zk prime field)

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"math/big"

	core "github.com/iden3/go-iden3-core"
)

// Generate Identity Profile from Genesis Identifier
func main() {

    id, _ := core.IDFromString("11BBCPZ6Zq9HX1JhHrHT3QKUFD9kFDEyJFoAVMptVs")

    profile, _ := core.ProfileID(id, big.NewInt(50))

    fmt.Println(profile.String())

}
```
