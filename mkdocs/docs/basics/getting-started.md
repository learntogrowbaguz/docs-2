# Getting Started

## Zero-knowledge Proofs
To learn how to create [zero-knowledge](../basics/key-concepts.md#zero-knowledge-proofs) proofs, have a look at [Circom and SnarkJS guide](../circom-snarkjs/index.md).

The process starts with employing various techniques of writing circuits for zero-knowledge proofs; it then moves on to creating and verifying a proof off-chain and finishes off by showing you how to replicate the process on-chain with Ethereum.
